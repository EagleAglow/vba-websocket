 VBA Websocket Sample (Echo Server Client)

 While searching for examples of VBA code that use the Websocket protocol,
I found the original Microsoft example code for an echo server client
(copy in WinHttpWebSocketSample.bas).

The files for "Main.bas" and "WinHttpCommon.bas" can be imported into 
VBA to make a client that works with an echo server, thanks to: https://websocket.org/
